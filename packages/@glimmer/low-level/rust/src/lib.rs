// This unstable feature is required for the `page` module which accesses the
// raw wasm memory allocation instructions for now. Eventually we may move
// to libstd allocations but for now it's intended to be an allocator with a
// smaller code-size footprint as in theory it's not necessary for this
// appplication to need a full-blown allocator.

// This unstable feature is currently used for the `wasm_bindgen` macro which
// allows us to define Rust code and have TypeScript automatically generated
// for consumption elsewhere.
