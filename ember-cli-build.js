  // * Next we do some postprocessing on this wasm file, executing tools like

  // * After that we execute `wasm-bindgen` which will read the wasm file and
  //   generate a typescript module corresponding to what the wasm exposes.
  // * Finally we'll do a "poor man's include" of the wasm into the JS module
  //   system by creating a module that simply contains the base64 encoded
  //   string of the wasm module itself.
